# OpenGDOI
OpenGDOI is an implementation of the Group Domain of Interpretation protocol as defined in RFC6407. It also implements protocols as defined in RFC4046 (Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture).

# Project Overview:
OpenGDOI is designed to address the need for secure and scalable communication within Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), drawing inspiration from the principles of the Cisco GETVPN architecture. The project aims to provide a transparent and efficient solution for securing multicast traffic, enabling organizations to safeguard their data in transit across interconnected network devices.

# Key Features:

- **Open Source Foundation:** OpenGDOI embraces the ethos of open-source development, fostering collaboration and community-driven innovation. By providing access to the project's source code, it encourages transparency, customization, and the collective expertise of the networking community.

- **GETVPN Compatibility:** OpenGDOI is crafted to be fully compatible with the Cisco GETVPN protocol, ensuring seamless integration into existing network infrastructures that rely on Cisco's proprietary solution. This compatibility facilitates a smooth transition for organizations seeking an open-source alternative.

- **Group Key Management:** The project incorporates the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) protocol, emphasizing secure group key management. OpenGDOI enables the establishment and distribution of cryptographic keys efficiently, supporting the encryption and decryption of group traffic in a scalable manner.

- **Rekeying Mechanisms:** OpenGDOI recognizes the importance of periodic rekeying for sustained security. The project integrates robust mechanisms to handle the generation and distribution of new group keys, maintaining a high level of cryptographic strength over time.

#Community Collaboration:
OpenGDOI thrives on the power of collaboration. The project invites network security enthusiasts, developers, and organizations to actively participate in its growth. Whether through code contributions, bug reporting, or sharing insights, the community plays a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of OpenGDOI.
